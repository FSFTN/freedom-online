The IT-ACT: Primer
==========

So what the hell is the IT ACT?

What does it deal with? 

What are the problems?

The IT act has been used to suppress freedom of expression (Cartoonist Azim Trivedi), has led to the arrest of people trying to speak out against public nuisance of the Siva sena (Girls arrested for FB 'Likes'), 

The most problematic: Section 66A
---------------------------------

> 66A. Punishment for sending offensive messages through communication service, etc.
> 
> Any person who sends, by means of a computer resource or a communication device,—
> 
> (a) any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character; or
> 
> (b) any information which he knows to be false, but for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will, persistently by making use of such computer resource or a communication device,
> 
> (c) any electronic mail or electronic mail message for the purpose of causing annoyance or inconvenience or to deceive or to mislead the addressee or recipient about the origin of such messages,
> 
> shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine.
 

> Explanation.— For the purpose of this section, terms “electronic mail” and “electronic mail message” means a message or information created or transmitted or received on a computer, computer system, computer resource or communication device including attachments in text, images, audio, video and any other electronic record, which may be transmitted with the message.

The problems
------------

Well, where do we start? Offensive is a 'very' vague term. It's not defined adequately clearly and by itself is a very poor choice of word. Anybody could be offended by anything. So point (a) is just too vague to exist in a legal decree. And the claimant can simply state that a completely benign email or a post online caused danger to him/her without sufficient proof and the person who sent it can be arrested easily.

Annoyance, inconvenience, obstruction, insult, ill will: all these words really mean nothing. They're just moot words added to increase the scope of this ammendment. The word "persistently" isn't elaborated. Is twice persistent? Will I be jailed if I cause inconvenience twice for the same duration as some cyber stalker who sends a few hundred messages? 

'Sending' does not necessarily mean sending a message to a single or multiple recipients. Vague wording means 'sending' can also mean posting stuff online or electronically publishing content because, well, we are 'sending' stuff to a server! Wow!

Three years is too much jail time for causing annoyance. That's unfair and a bit of a stretch. 

The improvements
----------------
1. Clearer definitions for what constitute crimes
1.a. Clearer definitons of ALL the terms 
2. Uniformity with offline legal processes
3. Burden of proof should be on accuser
